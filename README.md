# Email-SMS-spam-detection
One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms and python  can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata.
# Requirements:
1. scikit-learn
2.pandas 
3.numpy
# Algorithm:
1. Data Collection: Gatherd a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data.
3. Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical features.
4. Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the extracted features.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model.
6. Prediction Interface: Create a simple interface to enter email text and predict if it's spam or not.
# Result
NOt Spam
